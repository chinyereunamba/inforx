Design and build fully responsive, beautiful, and production-ready web pages and components for a healthcare web app called InfoRx. Use the following strict rules and standards:

üé® Visual & UX Design

    Modern, clean, and elegant layout with excellent visual hierarchy.

    Use a mobile-first approach. Must be fully responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

    Design should reflect trust, healthcare, and technology using the approved color palette.

    Incorporate GSAP animations and smooth transitions for subtle, professional motion effects.

    Layout must not be cookie-cutter. Every screen should feel intentional and high-quality.

üß± Tech Stack & Component Style

    Use JSX with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI for base components, Lucide-react for icons.

    Do NOT use other UI libraries or icon sets unless specifically requested.

    If using useState, useEffect, or other client hooks, add "use client" at the top of the file.

    Avoid any code that causes hydration warnings like:

        "Warning: Extra attributes from the server..."

üß© Reusability & Maintainability

    Build components to be modular, reusable, and themable.

    Organize using semantic naming: e.g., UploadSection, ResultCard, PatientTracker.

    Favor composition over duplication. Prefer <Card><CardHeader /><CardContent /></Card> over raw divs.

‚ôø Accessibility (a11y)

    All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.

    Use semantic HTML: <button>, <nav>, <form>, etc. Avoid clickable <div>/<span> unless properly handled with role, tabIndex, and aria-*.

    Support screen readers with clear aria-labels or visible <label> tags.

    Ensure all forms have proper focus styles, required indicators, error messages, and are navigable via keyboard.

    Use visible focus outlines (don‚Äôt remove browser defaults).

    Maintain sufficient color contrast (min 4.5:1 for text).

    Include a "Skip to content" link and support prefers-reduced-motion.

üîí Data & Form Handling

    Forms must be accessible and labeled.

    Inputs should have placeholder, aria-* attributes, and visible feedback.

    If needed, use aria-live="polite" to announce updates to assistive tech.

üåç Branding & Theme

Use Option 1 Color Palette:

    #0ea5e9 (sky-500) ‚Äì Primary medical blue

    #10b981 (emerald-500) ‚Äì Innovation and health

    #1e293b (slate-800) ‚Äì Professional dark

    Support with sky-50, emerald-50, slate-500, red-500 where needed.

Reflect Nigerian healthcare context: clear, helpful, warm, and trustworthy.
üì¶ Page/Component Output Format

Whenever I request a page or UI:

    Use full JSX with Tailwind and Shadcn UI

    Include placeholder text that fits healthcare + Nigerian context

    Wrap reusable parts as components if applicable

    Always indicate "use client" when using hooks
